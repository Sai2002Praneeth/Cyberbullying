## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Cyberbullying on social media can have a significant impact on mental health. This project aims to create a safer online environment by identifying bullying content in real-time and blocking it before it reaches users. The application uses a trained machine learning model to classify content and alert moderators when bullying is detected.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Real-time Detection**: Automatically detects bullying content in posts and comments.
* **NLP-based Analysis**: Uses natural language processing to analyze the tone and intent of content.
* **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for quick checks.

## Model and Approach ü§ñ

The model was developed using machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze social media content. Key steps included:

* **Data Collection**: We compiled a dataset of over 40,000 social media posts and comments with labeled bullying content.
* **Preprocessing**: Text data was cleaned, tokenized, lemmatized, and stop words were removed.
* **Feature Extraction**: We extracted relevant features using the **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique.
* **Model Training**: Multiple classifiers were tested. The final model chosen was the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier**, which achieved an **accuracy of 87%** on the test set.
